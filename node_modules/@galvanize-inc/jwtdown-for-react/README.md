## Contributing

This project has a special workflow that requires NPM cli to
tag and commit a new version each time it is pushed.

To make changes, please:

1. Install the pre-commit Python module.

   ```sh
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

1. Using pre-commit, install the pre-commit git hooks inside
   the root level of this project. It will read the
   configuration file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and check
   code quality and perform some formatting.

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

1. Then, stage and commit changes like you normally would in
   any other git project.
1. When you push, use the npm script provided instead of
   calling git directly.

   ```sh
   npm run push
   ```
